**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Adds a `device state` sensor, a `battery level` sensor and a `signal` sensor (disabled by default) for each device.
`siren` | Represents Elro Connects alarms as a siren. Turn the siren `ON` to test it. Turn it `OFF` to silence the (test) alarm.

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `elro_connects`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/elro_connects/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Elro Connects"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have something like this:

```text
custom_components/elro_connects/translations/en.json
custom_components/elro_connects/translations/nl.json
custom_components/elro_connects/__init__.py
custom_components/elro_connects/api.py
custom_components/elro_connects/sensor.py
custom_components/elro_connects/siren.py
custom_components/elro_connects/config_flow.py
custom_components/elro_connects/const.py
custom_components/elro_connects/manifest.json
...
```

## Configuration is done in the UI

***IMPORTANT NOTICE***

It seems the API security for the K1 connector has will be been improved soon and the access key will no longer supplied by the K1 connector. This will break this integration. As soon as there is a work-a-round for this, an update will be supplied.
